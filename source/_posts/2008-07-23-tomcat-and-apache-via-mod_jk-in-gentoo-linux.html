Once again, I was resorting things out, cleaning the mess and placing services in logical order on different machines. So, once again, I had to configure tomcat to work with apache on one standard port. A year ago, I found tutorial made by some debian h4x0rz, but I lost my bookmarks so many times since then (thnq, firefox devs). Happily, my configuration files are still there, so I will document it this time.

1. Install apache2, tomcat6 and mod_jk.

2. Append this to httpd.conf

LoadModule jk_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_jk.so
# loggging
JkLogFile /usr/lib/apache2/logs/mod_jk.log
# Where to find workers.properties
JkWorkersFile /etc/apache2/jk-workers.properties
# Select the log format
JkLogStampFormat "[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y] "
# JkOptions indicate to send SSL KEY SIZE,
JkOptions +ForwardKeySize +ForwardURICompat -ForwardDirectories
# JkRequestLogFormat set the request format
JkRequestLogFormat "%w %V %T"
# Send servlet for context / jsp-examples to worker named worker1
JkMount /jsp-examples worker1
# Send JSPs for context /jsp-examples/* to worker named worker1
JkMount /jsp-examples/* worker1

#application specific (my is called pdd)

# Send servlet for context / jsp-examples to worker named worker1
JkMount /pdd worker1
# Send JSPs for context /jsp-examples/* to worker named worker1
JkMount /pdd/* worker1

2. Create directory /usr/lib/apache2/logs/ and empty fileÂ /usr/lib/apache2/logs/mod_jk.log
3. Append this to jk-workers.properties

workers.tomcat_home=/var/lib/tomcat-5.5
workers.java_home=/opt/sun-jdk-1.6.0.03/
ps=/
worker.list=worker1
worker.default.port=8009
worker.default.host=localhost
worker.default.type=ajp13
worker.default.lbfactor=1

4. /etc/init.d/apache2 restart &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/tomcat-6 restart
