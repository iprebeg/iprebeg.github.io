Ho Ho Ho.

Even it is holidays time, I'm not slacking. So, I wrote my first Linux kernel module, as a part of research in enhanced kernel-based proxying with closed-source apps that doesn't allow to use proxies. Lots of phun:-) I also manage to design GUI in Matlab (:-), and still I'm fighting with shell scripting in Windows, as part of HMM-based speech recognition project. Also lots of phun. There is a XMLDB-based project, which showed nice progress. I don't know about eXist or Xindice, but Sedna is really unstable XMLDB and I'm not satisfied with it. This project is just a port project based on Informix ORDB. During that one, I learned a lot of C# and I must admit that it is a hell of language. Slow, but damn powerful. A recently finished project in distributed computing was presented to assistant professors and they asked h4z4rd and me if we could present it at class. As h4z4rd is having a nice time at CCC rightÂ  now, I'm having sex with designing presentation and recording desktop movies. <a href="http://www.zesoi.fer.hr">ZESOI</a> got two PS3s, so we took one and installed Gentoo Linux on it. It is going to be used for protein docking simulations. It is a quite nice machine.

New Year's trip was cancelled due to lack of funds:-D. Hey, so what, I run my code on Core2Quad now.

That's it for now, see you next year. Happy holidays.
