Yesterday, I became BSc in Computer Science, weeeee:) My parents and sister visited me and we attended nice ceremony organized by <a title="Fakultet Elektrotehnike i Racunarstva" href="http://www.fer.hr" target="_blank">FER</a> and had lunch in kewl private vegetarian restaurant <a title="Holistički centar Pyr" href="http://www.pyr-centar.com" target="_blank">Pyr</a>. It was really awsome.

All in all, those are best three years of my life. Let's get the Master now.
