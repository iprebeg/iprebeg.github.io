To stay with good old tradition of all bad developers, it starts with hello world...

Content of this blog will be related mostly to nerd stuff, like Linux, sockets and function pointers. Maybe some day, beautiful princess will came and turn this antisocial geeky frog into prince:). But, until then, rather go out and play.
