is actually very bad idea:-)  Let's say that you have a script which needs to SSH to remote host and get some data. Hardcoded password is bad, oh, very bad idea.  What you could do is this:

1. Issue ssh-keygen command on local machine (the one where your script is executed)

2. Issue ssh-keygen command on remote machine (the one which your script need to access to)

3. On remote machine, create file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with 0600 permissions and paste into it first (and only) line Â from ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub, stored in LOCAL machine.

4. Repeat those steps every time you change your public key

You should be able to log in to remote machine without passing password.
