If you run some soft of Linux and you have iPhone which you sync in virtual machine in VirtualBox, you may run into problems when updating iPhone firmware... 
When iPhone gets into recovery mode, usb can't be attached to virtual machine in VirtualBox... 

Finally, I found out that you have to run VirtualBox as root!
