Eh, even I said that I choosed Tomato firmware, I changed my mind and reflashed Linksys with OpenWRT. Configuration was really smooth and everything works well. I must admit that I feel much more comfortable using CLI and editing real files then making changes in web interface. There was no time to make harder tests, but I think I can see nice bandwidth improvment. I also tried X-Wrt (webif) but I didn't found anything that thrills me or that I can't do with CLI so I removed it. It is so kewl to have package management inside such a small device.

Also, I switched kernel on my laptop from gentoo-sources to tuxonice-sources. The thing is I wanted laptop to autohibernate when battery reaches critical state. Small script found in gentoo documentation did the job. /me likes.
