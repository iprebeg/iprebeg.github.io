Late March 2013 I visited Amazon offices in Seattle for interview. Got an offer few days after flying out. WHOAT ACCEPTED!?!1!! 

Then I got email from immigration attorney asking me to send my documents as soon as possible. Sure. What lottery?! Gee, there is frickin' lottery for H1B as well!? My chances were around 60%. Didn't get through, was never much of a gambler. Better luck next year. Damn!

Thing I regret is not visiting Bruce Lee's grave to pay respects while I was there. Not gonna miss it next time.
