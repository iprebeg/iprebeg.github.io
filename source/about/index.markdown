My name is Ivor Prebeg. I am software engineer living Zagreb, Croatia. I work as developer in Network Technologies department of <a title="SedamIT" href="http://www.sedamit.hr/">SedamIT</a>. I spend my free time developing iOS, solving problems on HackerRank and Kaggle and watching stuff on Coursera.
