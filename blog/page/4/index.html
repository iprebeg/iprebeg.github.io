			Slacking and Having Phun</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		As I am at parents house since friday, I am spending most of my time lying on the bed and watching documentaries. When I&#8217;m not slacking off, I&#8217;m testing spamassassin&#8217;s bayesian classificator learning script which I wrote recently, doing regular administration tasks and play with new Linksys WRT54GL router.

After a few days of searching for advices and reading reviews, I finally decided to flash Linksys with <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Tomato_Firmware">Tomato firmware</a>. I also considered installing <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/">DD-WRT</a> and <a href="http://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>. A stock Linksys firmware wasn&#8217;t bad for me, but what I wanted is shell on MIPS machine. Someone would say that I could use a simulator, but I think it is like having an intercourse with a rubber doll. So, I didn&#8217;t need so many features provided by DD-WRT, which is also reported to freeze (manuall reboot needed in every few days). OpenWRT seemed to be quite nice l33t thingy, but it requires more time then I want to spend. So Tomato satisfied my needs, installation was smooth and everything works like a charm. Just in few hours, nice idea poped-up. Right now, I am building cross compiler for MIPS and I am looking forward to try it out with Linksys.

Oh, almost forgot to mention that I managed to build OpenOffice-3.0.0_beta2. For now, it seems to be very nice and even there is no docx suffix in browse filters, it opened one without producing (visible) errors.

Cheers

			Summer Summary</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Since my last post, I mostly took the time to enjoy the summer. As health always comes first and me being paranoid about it, I decided to make another examination to make sure that my sight problem has nothing to do with neural stuff. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging">MRI</a> of my brain was made (and payed:-) in private clinic in Zagreb, named <a href="http://www.medikol.hr">Medikol</a>. Maybe I&#8217;ll post some pics of my CPU :-D if I manage to get them in digital format. Results were done in less then half an hour and I was told that everything is fine up there.

A day after examination, I took the bus to Omiš, a nice place at seaside near Split, and stayed there for three days with my family, who were there on vacation. Sea was a bit cold, but that didn&#8217;t stop me to swim and stay on the beach. We also met a lot of our relatives who live there. It was a bit of pain in the ass to get back to Zagreb as it is tourist season and roads are crowded but I got there just in time.

Same evening, I packed things in new shiny Ferrino Transalp 75 <a href="http://www.ferrino.it/en/homepage/products/BACKPACKS/trekking_105/TRANSALP_75_885">backpack</a> I bought right after MRI. It was a really cheap in comparasion with Lowe Alpine Summit 65+15 <a href="http://www.lowealpine.com/Products/Detail.asp?ProductTypeID=10&amp;ProductGroupID=1233&amp;Position=13&amp;SpecificActivityID=">backpack</a> which costs more than a twice. It is really nice how many things you can stuff inside and carry it around.  Early in the morning, g09o, h4z4rd, i72852 and I took the train to Rijeka and spent most of the day lying on the grass in the park and eating ice-cream while we were waiting for catamaran to take us to Cres island. As we got in the AC Slatina in Martinšćica, we setup the tent and went to the beach. We spent a week there, playing volleyball, swiming  and sunbathing during the daytime and drinking milk and playing cards in the evenings (yeah, we drank no alcohol). One afternoon, we *walked* (g09o gave up and came back after 45 min, we walked for about 3 hours) to Lubenice, but when we got there, we realized that we have no time to go to the beach, as it was too far so we hitch-hiked back to camp. We also met some kind Italian guys. Good thing is that we brought no laptops, which we actually did last year and instead of hacking, h4z4rd and I practiced yoga. Even we slept in very small tent fulfilled with bugs and didn&#8217;t ate proper food, this was greatest vacation ever. As they say, &#8220;sleeping bag, 350kn, tent 570 kn, h4z4rd&#8217;s feet peeking out of the tent, priceless&#8221;.

Right now, I am sitting in the office after testing some NFS stuff. I&#8217;m about to buy Linksys WRT54GL, h4ck it with OpenWRT and install it at parents house, as sister is expecting a shiny new pinky Dell Inspirion so we get rid of bloody cables. I plan to be with family next week and then get back in Zagreb as new semester starts on 8. of September. Till then, I&#8217;ll continue to hack a hoax recognition bash script and have phun with IKE stuff I already mentioned.

Like summers, tough.

			Solving Health Problems&#8230;</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Last few weeks passed like a second. I tried to spend time with my family which is situated for about 250 km away (2:50 hours traveling by train), so I ended up spending a pretty much (for a well situated student) cash on train tickets and being chronicaly tired.

Also, I decided that it is time to solve my sight problems. After visiting my doctor and telling her that I see double pictures when looking with only right eye, I was pretty sure that I will have to visit neurologist. It was really **cked up to find oftalmologist which wasn&#8217;t on vacation. After all, I found pretty kind one, who told me that I my sight is bad, but no neuro problems (later confirmed by neurologist). So now, as every regular geek, I wear glasses. Besides that, I wanted to make a blood analysis, as I recently became vegetarian. Everything was OK with that, too.

Everything seems to be fine at job, besides we had to spend few days (or weeks) at bosses house doing very boring archiving stuff, but at least I ate properly there.

The thing which makes me happy is fact that besides yoga, I have enough free time to work on analyzing implementation of one of IKEv2 daemons and figuring out how to implement an intresting draft. I will post no futher details about that until I entirely understand the existing code.

H4ppy h4ck1n9!

			Tomcat and Apache via Mod_jk in Gentoo Linux</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Once again, I was resorting things out, cleaning the mess and placing services in logical order on different machines. So, once again, I had to configure tomcat to work with apache on one standard port. A year ago, I found tutorial made by some debian h4x0rz, but I lost my bookmarks so many times since then (thnq, firefox devs). Happily, my configuration files are still there, so I will document it this time.

1. Install apache2, tomcat6 and mod_jk.

2. Append this to httpd.conf

LoadModule jk_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_jk.so
# loggging
JkLogFile /usr/lib/apache2/logs/mod_jk.log
# Where to find workers.properties
JkWorkersFile /etc/apache2/jk-workers.properties
# Select the log format
JkLogStampFormat &#8220;[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y] &#8221;
# JkOptions indicate to send SSL KEY SIZE,
JkOptions +ForwardKeySize +ForwardURICompat -ForwardDirectories
# JkRequestLogFormat set the request format
JkRequestLogFormat &#8220;%w %V %T&#8221;
# Send servlet for context / jsp-examples to worker named worker1
JkMount /jsp-examples worker1
# Send JSPs for context /jsp-examples/* to worker named worker1
JkMount /jsp-examples/* worker1

#application specific (my is called pdd)

# Send servlet for context / jsp-examples to worker named worker1
JkMount /pdd worker1
# Send JSPs for context /jsp-examples/* to worker named worker1
JkMount /pdd/* worker1

2. Create directory /usr/lib/apache2/logs/ and empty file /usr/lib/apache2/logs/mod_jk.log
3. Append this to jk-workers.properties

workers.tomcat_home=/var/lib/tomcat-5.5
workers.java_home=/opt/sun-jdk-1.6.0.03/
ps=/
worker.list=worker1
worker.default.port=8009
worker.default.host=localhost
worker.default.type=ajp13
worker.default.lbfactor=1

4. /etc/init.d/apache2 restart &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/tomcat-6 restart

			Hardcoding Passwords in Scripts</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		is actually very bad idea:-)  Let&#8217;s say that you have a script which needs to SSH to remote host and get some data. Hardcoded password is bad, oh, very bad idea.  What you could do is this:

1. Issue ssh-keygen command on local machine (the one where your script is executed)

2. Issue ssh-keygen command on remote machine (the one which your script need to access to)

3. On remote machine, create file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with 0600 permissions and paste into it first (and only) line  from ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub, stored in LOCAL machine.

4. Repeat those steps every time you change your public key

You should be able to log in to remote machine without passing password.

	<div class="entry-content">
		Yet again it was a just regular coding break. I ssh-ed to my home server, sudo-ed as root, read e-mail about portage tree update. I issued emerge -uavDN world and watched cups, samba and a lot of other stuff getting compiled and upgraded to some newer version. I restarted all services and got back to work. Three minutes after, my roommate was screaming about printer (shared via samba) doesn&#8217;t work on her laptop and her essay which must be done until tommorow. After few hours of revisiting all bloody guide&#8217;s and howtos and conf files, I&#8217;ve found a thread on gentoo forums telling something about /etc/mime.convs&#8230; Yeah yeah, etc-update replaced it (of course, it was me, not the script) and uncommenting line

application/octet-stream  application/vnd.cups-raw  0 -

solved it. Back to work, hope so&#8230;
